Test command

two ways to represent a test command
$test -e test/file/path
[ -e test/file/path ]

Flags that will be a thing for the test command
-e //Checks if the file/directory exists
-f //Checks if the file/directory exists and is a regular file
-d //Checks if the file/directory exists and is a directory

if no flags has been specified, the -e functionality will be used by default.

Remember to add an extra feature that the test command currently does not have
if a command + flag + path returns a true value then print out (True) otherwise print out (False)

Test comman should also work with the connectors
